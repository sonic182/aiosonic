===================
Welcome to aiosonic
===================

A really fast, lightweight Python asyncio HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and WebSocket client.

Current version is |release|.

The repository is hosted on GitHub_: 

.. _GitHub: https://github.com/sonic182/aiosonic


Features
========

- Keepalive support and a smart pool of connections
- Multipart file uploads
- Handling of chunked responses and requests
- Connection timeouts and automatic decompression
- Automatic redirect following
- Fully type-annotated code
- WebSocket support
- Comprehensive test coverage (nearly 100%)
- HTTP/2 (BETA; enabled via a flag)

Requirements
============

- Python >= 3.8 (or PyPy 3.8+)

Installation
============

.. code-block:: bash

 $ pip install aiosonic


Getting Started
===============

Below is a basic example of using aiosonic's HTTP client:

.. code-block:: python

 import asyncio
 import aiosonic
 import json
 
 async def run():
     client = aiosonic.HTTPClient()
 
     # Sample GET request
     response = await client.get('https://www.google.com/')
     assert response.status_code == 200
     assert 'Google' in (await response.text())
 
     # POST data as multipart form
     url = "https://postman-echo.com/post"
     posted_data = {'foo': 'bar'}
     response = await client.post(url, data=posted_data)
     assert response.status_code == 200
     data = json.loads(await response.content())
     assert data['form'] == posted_data
 
     # POST data as JSON
     response = await client.post(url, json=posted_data)
     assert response.status_code == 200
     data = json.loads(await response.content())
     assert data['json'] == posted_data
 
     # GET request with timeouts
     from aiosonic.timeout import Timeouts
     timeouts = Timeouts(sock_read=10, sock_connect=3)
     response = await client.get('https://www.google.com/', timeouts=timeouts)
     assert response.status_code == 200
     assert 'Google' in (await response.text())
 
     print('HTTP client success')
 
 if __name__ == '__main__':
     asyncio.run(run())


WebSocket Example
=================

This example demonstrates how to use the WebSocket support provided by aiosonic.

.. code-block:: python

 import asyncio
 from aiosonic import WebSocketClient
 
 async def main():
     # Replace with your WebSocket server URL
     ws_url = "ws://localhost:8080"  
     async with WebSocketClient() as client:
         async with await client.connect(ws_url) as ws:
             # Send a text message.
             await ws.send_text("Hello WebSocket")
             
             # Receive the echo response.
             response = await ws.receive_text()
             print("Received:", response)
             
             # Send a ping and wait for the pong response.
             await ws.ping(b"keep-alive")
             pong = await ws.receive_pong()
             print("Pong received:", pong)
             
             # Gracefully close the connection.
             await ws.close(code=1000, reason="Normal closure")
 
 if __name__ == "__main__":
     asyncio.run(main())


Benchmarks
==========

Below is a basic performance benchmark comparing aiosonic with other HTTP clients:

.. code-block:: bash

 $ python scripts/performance.py
 doing tests...
 {
  "aiosonic": "1000 requests in 105.53 ms",
  "aiosonic cyclic": "1000 requests in 104.08 ms",
  "aiohttp": "1000 requests in 184.51 ms",
  "requests": "1000 requests in 1644.21 ms"
 }
 aiosonic is 74.84% faster than aiohttp
 aiosonic is 1457.99% faster than requests
 aiosonic is -1.38% faster than aiosonic cyclic

Note that these benchmarks are machine-dependent and intended only as a rough comparison.
